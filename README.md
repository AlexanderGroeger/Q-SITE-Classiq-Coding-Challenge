To complete the Q-SITE Classiq Coding challenge, you must:
* Fork this GitHub repository (or download the challenge files)
* Work on the four notebooks which comprise the challenge in your fork
* Once completed, you should have a QASM file generated from each of the notebooks
* * Use the code snippet provided at the end of the first challenge, for example, to generate QASM files.
